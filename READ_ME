Peer garded assignment: getting and cleaning data course project
This repository is a submission for GETTING AND CLEANING DATA coursera project. it has instructions on how to run analysis on Human Acitivity Recognition dataset.
DATASET used can be obtained from:
 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
And the data for the project is available on :
 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
 FILES ARE FURTHER ATTACHED FOR CODE-BOOK AND THE PROGRAM.
 CODE-BOOK describes all the variables, the data and any transformations of the work performed.
 run_analysis is an uploadaed text file for the code to perform the action.
 The same code of run_analysis is again provided in the "CODE" attachment in case the access to the text file is not possible.

The run_analysis.R text contains program that performs the following steps as directed in the instructions for the program:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
