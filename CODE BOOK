run_analysis.R scrpt performs the cleanin of the data to obtain a TIDY dataset from the data obtained.
1. Download the dataset:
 the data set is download and the files have been extracted in the folder named UCI HAR Dataset.

2. Assign each data to variables:
>features<-read.table("features.txt",col.names=c("n","functions"))
  features selected for this database com from the accelerometr and gyroscope raw signals.
> activities<-read.table("activity_labels.txt",col.names=c("code","activity"))
 List of activities performed when corresponding measurements were taken.
> subject_test<-read.table("test/subject_test.txt",col.names="subject")
 Contains test data of 9/30 volunteeer test subjects being observed.
> x_test<-read.table("test/X_test.txt",col.names=features$functions)
 Contains recorded features test data.
> y_test<-read.table("test/y_test.txt",col.names="code")
  Contains test data of acitvities.
> subject_train<-read.table("train/subject_train.txt",col.names="subject")
  Has test data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed.
> x_train<-read.table("train/X_train.txt",col.names=features$functions) 
 Contains recorded features train data.
> y_train<-read.table("train/y_train.txt",col.names="code")
  Contains trained data of activities.
  
3.Merges train and tes datasets:
> X<-rbind(x_train,x_test)
 Created by merging x_train and x_test.
> Y<-rbind(y_train,y_test)
 Created by mergibngy_train and y_test.
> Subject<-rbind(subject_train,subject_test)
 Created b merging subject_train and subject_test.
> Merged_Data<-cbind(Subject,X,Y)
 Final merged dataset.
 
4.Extracting on basis of mean and standard deviation:
> TidyData<-Merged_Data %>% select(subject,code,contains("mean"),contains("std"))
> TidyData$code<-activities(TidyData$code,2)

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name several activities:
  entire numbers in the code column of TidyData replaced with corresponding acitvity taken from second column of the activities variable.
  
6. From the above modified dataset creates a second independant and tidy dataset with average of each variable for each activity and subject.
this data has been stored under FinalData file.
